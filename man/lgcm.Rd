\title{Create a latent growth curve model}
\usage{
lgcm(timepoints = 0, intercept.variance = 0, slope.variance = 0,
  residual.variance = 0, intercept.slope.covariance = 0, sample.size = 0,
  intercept.mean = 0, slope.mean = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{timepoints}{Vector of time points of measurement occasions}

\item{intercept.variance}{Individual differences in intercept}

\item{slope.variance}{Individual differences in slopes}

\item{residual.variance}{Residual variance or inverse of the precision of measurement}

\item{intercept.slope.covariance}{The covariance between latent intercept and latent slope}

\item{sample.size}{Number of cases}

\item{intercept.mean}{Mean of the latent intercept (average score at intercept)}

\item{slope.mean}{Mean of the latent slope (average linear rate of change)}
}
